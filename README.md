Web3 Hands-On Exploration: Solidity Smart Contracts & On-Chain Interaction
This repository contains two simple Solidity smart contracts (Mood.sol and LW3Token.sol) written as part of a Web3 learning pathway based on beginner tutorials from LearnWeb3, a platform for newcomers to Web3 development.

Contracts
Mood.sol — demonstrates simple data storage behavior on chain, including setting and retrieving state.
LW3Token.sol — a basic ERC-20 style token contract that shows token creation and balance logic.
These contracts are not intended for production but serve as practical, hands-on examples of core Web3 building blocks written during structured learning.
